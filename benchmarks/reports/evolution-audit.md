## Expected failures



## Limits

- The harness records deterministic observables and declared capabilities; it does not implement or approve evolution mechanics.
- Presentation-only impact identity and cosmetic entity-count differences are deliberately excluded from non-cosmetic delta counts.
- Expected failures preserve known gameplay-flat production evolutions as visible debt rather than weakening invariants.
